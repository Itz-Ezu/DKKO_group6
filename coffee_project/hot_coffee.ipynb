    "# Hot Coffe Mod\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "As programming students, our reliance on coffee is a well-known stereotype, especially during intense periods like exam weeks. This project stems from a personal and practical interest in understanding the real-world health implications of this habit. The primary objective is to analyze and model the impact of coffee consumption on key health and wellness indicators using the provided dataset. Rather than stopping at simple correlations, our goal is to determine whether coffee intake is a significant predictive factor for specific health outcomes, especially when compared to other lifestyle choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary goal is to build a predictive model that can identify a caffeine threshold for negative health effects and determine its significance relative to other lifestyle factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will be successful if we can develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts a health outcome (like `Stress_Level` or `Sleep_Quality`) based on an individual's coffee consumption and other personal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Determine a Caffeine Threshold**: Can we identify a daily `Caffeine_mg` threshold above which the probability of 'Poor' `Sleep_Quality` or 'High' `Stress_Level` significantly increases, holding other factors constant? **Logistic Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify Key Health Predictors**: Which lifestyle habits— `Coffee_Intake`, `Alcohol_Consumption`, `Smoking`, or `Physical_Activity_Hours` —are the most significant predictors of `Health_Issues`? We will build a comprehensive model to predict the severity of these issues (`None`, `Mild`, `Moderate`, `Severe`) using a combination of all lifestyle factors. **Random Forests?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secondary Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Our secondary goal is to investigate if the health impacts of coffee are particularly pronounced for our demographic. Specifically, we want to see if the problem will become worse for us after landing for an 'Office' job.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Predicting Stress by Occupation**: Can we accurately predict a person's `Stress_Level` based on their daily `Caffeine_mg`, `Sleep_Hours`, and `Occupation`? **Random Forests?**\n"
